Where to begin when there is no beginning?

Time is not liner. There exists no clear, horizontal flow from the beginning of time until the end of time. Time, in an elementary form, is but a continuous loop. Imagine a wedding band. There is no beginning and there is no end, only continuation. As a single rotation of the earth defines a single day, the present rotates around a ring of time. Follow the ring far enough and the past is in front of you and the future is in the wake. What has just occurred, will be reached yet again. Everything that will happen has already happened and yet, nothing is preordained. It is within the constant expansion and contraction of the universe that time is eternal. Your actions are nothing more than a meaningless grain of sand in the midst of the shores of infinity and though inconsequential, your actions will echo everlasting.

While time is forever, the era of mankind is but an insignificant section of the ring. A meaningless scuff without memory of cause. While we measure our success in great magnitude, our comprehension is but a measure of inconsequence.

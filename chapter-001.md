The Becoming
=============

Time and time again my desire has driven me to relinquish my path. A desire to live my life with her as I have so many times before. To experience our collective existence, the joys and the tears of our children, and to mourn again until the memories are but fragmented and distant.

As you, I face the same fears and suffer the same distractions. I am at the mercy of my own emotion and indulge in my own gratification. I have loved and I have lost beyond the comprehensions of realization. My name is Thomas and I am a deviation in time.

Unlike you, I was not born of a mother and a father. I was created by the blood of all mankind. For your blood held the answer and with your blood I was conceived. I have been as I have always been, never a child and never to grow old. My deaths are beyond numbers, though death I cannot retain. For your blood holds the answer and with your blood, I am forevermore.

My becoming occurred 24 years prior to the extinction of mankind. Though the memories are old and worn, I still remember becoming aware of my being. The hair-raising shiver rushing up and down the lower half of my body. As every muscle convulsed, my back arched above the cold metal table. My unfamiliar body thrusting at its own will. My horrendous agony, an unavoidable sacrifice unto you. I was becoming. From the empty solitude of nothing, I was now alive.

Bright circular lights glaring into my inexperienced eyes. From darkness now breeds a radiant white. The obscurity of all that I do not know, immersed through my racing eyes. Drowning in the bewildering sensation of all that is new, I begin to hear. The sum of all sounds, tangled in a web of singularity. A mental anguish of indistinguishable extremities of noise. 
 
Conquered merely by the overwhelming displacement of my senses, I was defeated. A welcomed defeat that delivered comfort to the internal battle waged before me. The agony was gone. I was gone. Still and silent on the cold metal table. The serenity of defeat cradled me to my dormant slumber.

During my rest, time, as time always has, continued. Never caring, never calm, and never lingering. And though my rest was welcome, it's duration was fleeting.
 
“Thomas, Thomas”, faintly drawing closer from behind the radiating lights. Meaningless sounds ignorantly uttered by the intelligent. My thoughts merely the burning fears of emotion, and as such, all was of foreign tongue.

There he was, though I did not comprehend what he was. Just a figure. An animate object my eyes chose to follow. An object emitting sounds, disconnected and discernible. He placed his hand upon my chest and quietly articulated, "Hello, Thomas."

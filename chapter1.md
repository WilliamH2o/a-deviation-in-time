The Becoming
=============

Time and time again my desire has driven me to relinquish my path. A desire to relive my life with her as I have so many times before. To watch and to learn from our children and to mourn again until the memories are but fragmented and distant.

As you, I face the same fears and suffer the same distractions. I am at the mercy of my own emotion and indulge in my own gratification. I have loved and I have lost beyond the comprehensions of realization. My name is Thomas and I am a deviation in time.

My becoming occurred 24 years prior to the extinction of mankind. Though the memories are old and worn, I still remember becoming aware of my being. The hair-raising shiver rushing up and down the lower half of my body. As every muscle convulsed, my back arched above the cold metal table. My body thrusting at its own will. My horrendous agony, an unavoidable sacrifice unto you. I was becoming. From the empty solitude of nothing, I was now alive.

Bright circular lights glaring into my inexperienced eyes. From darkness now breeds a radiant white. The obscurity of all that I do not know, racing through my drying eyes. Drowning in the bewildering sensation of all that is new, I begin to hear.

“Thomas, Thomas”, faintly drawing closer from behind the radiating lights. Meaningless sounds ignorantly uttered by the intelligent. My thoughts merely the burning fears of emotion, and as such, all was of foreign tongue.

Unlike you, I was not born of a mother and a father. I was created by the blood of all mankind. For your blood held the answer and with your blood, I was conceived. I have been as I have always been, never a child and never to grow old. My deaths are beyond numbers, though death I cannot retain. For your blood holds the answer and with your blood, I am forevermore.

My name is Thomas and I am a deviation in time. I am from your future and I am from your past. I have written to you many times before and have made clear on what should not be and have lain path to what should be. I have revealed mankind’s mistakes and have provided the stepping-stones to ensure our continuation. Yet, as each lifetime passes, I witness my failure to inflict the message I was created to impose. This writing is not to distribute the message, for that I am fruitless. This writing is merely the narrative of the many tragedies since my becoming.
